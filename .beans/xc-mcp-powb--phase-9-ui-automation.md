Implement UI automation tools.

## Checklist
- [x] Use simctl for UI automation (accessibility APIs require additional setup)
- [x] tap tool
- [x] long_press tool
- [x] swipe tool
- [x] type_text tool
- [x] key_press tool
- [x] button tool
- [x] screenshot tool
- [x] Run tests to verify

Note: Some planned tools (gesture, key_sequence, touch, describe_ui) deferred as they require more complex accessibility integration.
