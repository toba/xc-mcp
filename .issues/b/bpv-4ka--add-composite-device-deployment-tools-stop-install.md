## Description

When deploying an app to a physical device during development, agents (and humans) need to run 3-4 separate steps every time:

1. Find the running process PID (`devicectl device info processes`)
2. Terminate it (`devicectl device process terminate --pid <pid>`)
3. Install the new build (`devicectl device install app`)
4. Launch the app (`devicectl device process launch`)

This is tedious and error-prone. The current `build_device` tool doesn't work (see gl6-64d), so agents fall back to `xcodebuild` + manual devicectl commands.

## Implemented Tools

### `deploy_device` (or enhance `build_run_device` if it exists)
Combine stop → install → launch into a single tool call:
- **Input**: `app_path` (path to .app bundle), `device` (UDID), optional `bundle_id`
- **Behavior**: 
  1. Look up running process by bundle_id or app name → terminate if running
  2. Install the .app bundle
  3. Launch the app
- **Output**: Confirm each step succeeded, return new PID

### `build_deploy_device`
Full pipeline: build → stop → install → launch:
- **Input**: `project_path` or `workspace_path`, `scheme`, `device` (UDID)
- **Behavior**:
  1. Build with `-destination "generic/platform=iOS"`
  2. Look up and terminate any running instance
  3. Install the built .app
  4. Launch the app
- **Output**: Build result + deployment confirmation

## Context

During a debugging session, I needed to deploy ~6 iterations of an app to an iPad mini. Each required 4 separate tool calls (or a single long bash command). A composite tool would have saved significant time and reduced errors (e.g., forgetting to terminate the old process, which means the new binary doesn't actually run).

## Related Issues

- gl6-64d: `build_device` fails to find connected device by UDID (xcodebuild destination issue)
- cfo-jj0: `stop_app_device` doesn't resolve bundle_id to PID


## Summary of Changes

### New Tools

- **`deploy_device`** — stop (if running) → install → launch in a single call. Takes `app_path`, `bundle_id`, and `device`.
- **`build_deploy_device`** — full pipeline: build → extract app path + bundle ID from build settings → stop → install → launch. Takes the same params as `build_device`.

### Registration

- Added to `DeviceToolName` enum, `DeviceMCPServer`, monolithic `XcodeMCPServer`, and `ServerToolDirectory`
- Both tools gracefully handle the case where the app isn't currently running (no error, just a skip message)
